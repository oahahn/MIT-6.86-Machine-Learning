## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. The training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. 

This project uses the scikit-learn package, the NumPy numerical toolbox and the matplotlib plotting toolbox.

Part of the code for this project was written by the course staff. Most of my work can be seen in the implementation of functions in project1.py and parameter tuning in main.py. My tasks were the following: 

* Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

* Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

* Tune hyperparameters to maximize the performance of each model.

## Project Objectives

The first half of this project focused on the implementation of a simple neural net with an architecture as shown in the figure below.

The net was implemented from scratch using some skeleton code in neural_nets.py.

The second half of this project focused on using deep neural networks to classify handwritten digits as in project 2.

## Project Objectives

The first half of this project focused on the implementation of a simple neural network with an architecture as shown in the figure below.

The network was implemented from scratch using some skeleton code in neural_nets.py.

The second half of this project focused on using deep neural networks to classify the multi-digit version of MNIST utilising the PyTorch framework. The script nnet_fc.py employs a fully-connected neural network and was used mainly to tweak parameters and assess the accuracy of the most basic form of a deep neural network. Most of code, however, was written in:

* nnet_cnn.py where I implemented a convolutional neural network
* mlp.py where I built a fully-connected model with a single hidden layer with 64 units
* conv.py where I built a convolutional model

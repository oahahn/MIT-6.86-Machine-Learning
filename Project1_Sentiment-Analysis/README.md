## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. 

In order to automatically analyze reviews, you will need to complete the following tasks:

Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.

## Course Description
An in-depth introduction to the field of machine learning, from linear models to deep learning and reinforcement learning, through hands-on Python projects. You will learn to: 

* Understand principles behind machine learning problems such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning
* Implement and analyze models such as linear models, kernel machines, neural networks, and graphical models
* Choose suitable models for different applications
* Implement and organize machine learning projects, from training, validation, parameter tuning, to feature engineering.
